# data-warehouse-project
Building a modern DWH with PostgreSQL, including ETL processes, data modeling and analytics

---

## DATA ARCHITECTURE
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
